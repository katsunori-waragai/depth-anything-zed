# Limitations
- There is no guarantee that depth-anything will return a depth proportional to the real space scale.
- The completion process in this method causes discrepancies and steps between the value in zed-sdk and the completed value.
- There is no basis for the validity of the policy of adopting the zed-sdk values as they are.
- Pixels that did not become inlier in RANSAC may have zed-sdk values that are far from the actual values.
